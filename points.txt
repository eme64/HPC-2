--- Set 01:    74 / 80
1a) 4/4
1b) 5/5
1c) 6/6


2) 29/30
-1 forgot omp in initialize_density()

3) 29/35
-1 missing strong scaling plot, but output seems ok
-1 proof for unbiased not as good as should be
-3 missing variance calculation
-1 missing plot, but data probably ok
(no bonus) was asked really weirdly, not really enough info to be solved.

--- Set 02:    44 / 50
1a) 10 / 10
1b) 9  / 10
-1 some small factor not carried over right
1c) 10 / 10

2.1) 8 / 8
2.2) 3 / 5
2.3) 4 / 7
