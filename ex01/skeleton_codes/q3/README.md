1. Implementation
    Implement your solutions in:
    * src/q1_integrands.c
    * src/q1_trapz.c
    * src/q1_mc.c

    main.c is not to be modified, but only used for 
    running.

2. Compiling
    A call to make should suffice. Makefile is written
    such that it runs seamlessly on Euler. Other platforms
    are supported on a best-effort basis.

3. Running
    ./main trapz or ./main mc will run
    serial, parallel and verification profiles.
